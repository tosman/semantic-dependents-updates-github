## Overview
This package can be useful for a family of inter-dependent NPM packages. The basic idea is this: when A package'
version is updated let's send a pull request to package B, changing A's dependency in its package.json to new version
and initiating CI test of B with new version of A.

This is similar to the way [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io) works, but it's a bit different:
* it's just a Node.js module, not an external service
* it works fine with private NPM packages (Greenkeeper currently doesn't support them, that's why I needed to create it)
* it's focused on single dependency package with a list of dependents, similarly to [dont-break](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dont-break)'s approach
* this module works even if you disable building pull requests at Travis and keep only building on 'push' - PR from
this module will be counted as 'push' there, because its branch will be in the same repository. This can be useful if
you don't want to allow pull requests from unknown forks to use your sensitive env vars defined at Travis.

This module plays perfectly with [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), see below for usage instructions.

Here's an example output from this module at CircleCI:

## Limitations
In case B depends on A this module creates a Git branch inside B's repository, so this only works if your Github
user have write access to B's repository. So basically this is a solution only for a case when you (or your
organisation) own the whole family of dependencies, which was exactly the case which this module was made to solve -
it was made for a company's own suite of private NPM modules.

## Installation
Install the package:
```
npm install -g @egis/semantic-dependents-updates-github
```

## Usage

* Create a GitHub token to be used by semantic-dependents-updates-github and put it to GH_TOKEN env variable.
You can also take (any of) GH_TOKEN created by https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release setup: it will
print it if you choose 'Other' CI instead of Travis.

* Define the dependent projects to be updated in package.json, e.g.:
```
  ...
  "name": "build-tools",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "semantic-dependents-updates": {
    "dependents": {
      "@egis/egis-ui": "git@github.com:egis/EgisUI.git",
      "@egis/esign": "git@github.com:egis/eSign.git",
      "@egis/portal-app": "git@github.com:egis/Portal.git"
    }
  },
  ...
```
Here we tell semantic-dependents-updates-github to create pull requests to change build-tools' version to "1.2.3" in
GitHub repos of "@egis/egis-ui", "@egis/esign" and "@egis/portal-app" packages. In case of semantic-release the version
will be the one that was just published.

* Use the 'semantic-dependents-updates-github' binary script in package.json' scripts section - this will create the
PRs. Example for integration with semantic-release:
```
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "semantic-release": "semantic-release pre && npm publish && semantic-release post && semantic-dependents-updates-github",
  },
  ...

```

## Configuration

The module config section in package.json can have following options, all of which are optional except "dependents". Example:
```
  ...
  "semantic-dependents-updates": {
    "dependents": {
      "@egis/egis-ui": "git@github.com:egis/EgisUI.git",
      "@egis/esign": "git@github.com:egis/eSign.git",
      "@egis/portal-app": "git@github.com:egis/Portal.git"
    },
    "branchNameBase": "autoupdate-build-tools",
    "branch": "my-branch",
    "author": {
      name: "semantic-dependents-updates-github bot",
      email: "semadep@nowhere.io"
    }
  },
  ...
```
* "dependents" list NPM package names and Github URLs of dependent packages
* "branch" is the target branch of dependent packages where pull request will be submitted to ("master" by default)
* "author" can be used to specify "author" info for the commit created by module, by default it's { name: "semantic-dependents-updates-github bot", email: "semadep@nowhere.io" }
* "branchNameBase" is a prefix of branch being created for pull request. Full branch name in this case will be like this: "autoupdate-build-tools-1.0.2-1459471368624". Default is "autoupdate".
